    <p>But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain <br>
         was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings <br> 
         of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, <br>
         or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue <br>
         pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone <br>
          who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally<br>
           circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, <br>
            which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? <br>
            But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying<br>
             consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure
